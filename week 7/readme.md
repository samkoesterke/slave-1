## Paper prototype ðŸ˜»
Here is an extremely simple paper version of what my project may look like. I want to focus on making it work on phones, as the dimensions for a lot of rugs are similar to that of smart phone screens. Currently I am researching API's and whether or not this is a possible solution for image sourcing. An alternative I'm thinking about is making a series of 4-6 parametric rugs using analogue methods, then having my algorithm select a rug at random on page load. This would re-link the tactile and analogue aspects of tapestry and rug making to my project. I'm finding that the current concept for my project is quite fluid.
