## Project development: 'Images of insignificance'
I've been researching API's including Google search api, Flickr, Instagram etc. The initial idea that I had was to have a random image scraped from one of these services which is then woven into my tapestry. I feel that with this concept there is a disconnect  Instead I will try to incorperate more analogue parametrics; namely using the same method with which I have been making the '12 hour challenge' posters. 

I stubbled upon this technique by chance many years ago; typing random numbers and letters into Google image search gives you some very strange results. Strange images without any context. This style of searching is almost like some kind of obscure digital archeology, unearthing and rediscovereing old images. To me these images lack significance, yet the fact that they are 'digital artefacts' they do in some way bare some significance. In many ways real life artefacts are just everyday objects. Here are some examples:

The plan is to set a 5 character google search parameter (e.g.  _ _ _ _ _ heads or tails will determine if the character will be a letter or a number, then depending on the outcome I will use 10 or 26 sided dice). Once this 5 character word has been generated I will use it in a google search and manually scrape 'images of insignificance'.
