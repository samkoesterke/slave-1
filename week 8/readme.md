## Project development: 'Images of insignificance'
I've been researching API's including Google search api, Flickr, Instagram etc. The initial idea that I had was to have a random image scraped from one of these services which is then woven into my tapestry. I feel that with this concept there is a disconnect  Instead I will try to incorperate more analogue parametrics; namely using the same method with which I have been making the '12 hour challenge' posters. 

The plan is to set 5 character google search parameters (e.g.  _ _ _ _ _ heads or tails will determine if the character will be a letter or a number, then depending on the outcome I will use 10 or 26 sided dice) once this 5 character word has been generated I will use it in a google search and manually scrape 'images of insignificance'.
