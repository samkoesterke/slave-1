# WEEK 10
## Project progress
This is the fun part for me. I want to look at rugs in a contemporary and simultaneously digial context. I'm focusing on symmetry and asymmetry, the shape of the rug, as well as the decay. For the decay, the aim is to have it occur in certain areas; as if there is an underlying structure. Places that are less likely to be affected by decay are borders and the edges of shapes. <br/>
